# CS1203- Data Structures

Welcome, This is the repository contians code submittions for CS-1203 offered in Monsoon 2022 by Prof Debayan Gupta

The files are serialized as per the submission requirements

I would also like to admit that most of the files might not be entirely consistent with how they were covered in class because I was unable to attend classes due to several health issues.

I would like to thank Soham Bagchi for helping me get familiar with C as well as for helping me understand tree structures properly
